It's the logical operator for negation. For example, "!(5>1)" returns FALSE while "!(1>5)" returns TRUE.

Negation is useful for complex logical formulations where it's often easier to express a complicated truth and just negate it, thus producing the logical equivalent to an even more complicated inverse.
